// IMPORTANT TODO / NEXT

- control Deck umschreiben

- camera debug when switching to same player
- players array should be changed, that it has always size 8 and points to same players all the time.

// known bugs
- foldedAI stuff is completely broke
- dealer button when one player leaves table forever
- camera debug when switching to same player (goes around the whole table)

// STRETCH GOALS

- actually need chips to display visually who has won
- highlighting winning cards
- improved help button (thinking of highlighting various things in interface and pointing at with arrows)
- possibility to adjust blinds / startingChips within option menu at the beginning 
- winning screen end of round / starting new round
- main menu setting names
- spin box disable negative values + create new design
- rename debugMessage() function
- pause menu
- getPot() is used by AI, but obsolet / wrong becuz of the amount of pots


// far-from stretch goals
- using project as a learning-software for poker beginners.


// GRAPHICS
- screen when player switches (press okay or sth before showing cards)


// PROGRAMMING
- destructors
