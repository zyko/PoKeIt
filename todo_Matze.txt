ToDo:


- make calculator global?

- deck!											[done] (hopefully)
- Ace can be 0 and 12 @ straight							[done]
- check what happens, when both players have flush, f. e.				[done]
- showing card graphics ( currently only triggering on "check button" by hud widget ) 	[done]
- increasing blinds after a certain amount of rounds					[done] currently 15
- winning Calculator									[done]
- split pot										[done]
- dealer management ( 2nd round, etc..)							[done]
- minimum betting / raising (in relation to bigBlind)					[done]
- pot / chips management when round is over						[done]
- side pot stuff (betRaise method)							[done]


// NEXT GOALS
- problem within showcardgraphic function of HUDwidget:
	getRoundStages > 0 triggers spawn flop, that means its gonna trigger with turn and river as well
	if getRoundStages == x, its trigger twice, when people go all-in before flop
- twoPairs win? debug!

- winning screen end of round / starting new round
- setting maximum to bet within HUDWidget
	

// MAIN MENU								
- mainMenu debugging
- selection of players ( currently set to 5 by default in two blueprint nodes )
- possibility to adjust blinds / startingChips within option menu at the beginning

// GRAPHICS
- graphics ( especially cards )	
- screen when player switches
- graphic animations
- show graphics for increasing blinds
- camera
- highlighting winning cards

// PROGRAMMING
- destructors
- problem, when raising would lead to creating new pot, e. g. p1 allin, p2 raises above p1's allin
- delete playerController stuff in calculator
- testing, testing, testing calculator


Fragen:

- wie wichtig ist kapselung?
	(in Hinblick auf: keyCards[] aus Calculator.cpp public) + pointer getter in RoundManager.cpp
